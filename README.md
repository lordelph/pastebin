Pastebin
========

This is the source code to the original pastebin.com, which I started
back in 2002. While the code was always available under a AGPL licence,
I sold the domain in 2010 due to the time required to deal with all the
copyright issues and other complaints the site drew. 

This tool was orignally designed to enable collaborative code review via 
the #php IRC channel. Inspired by www.parseerror.com/paste, but more 
streamlined and capable of allowing collabation via IRC by allowing easy 
modification of posted code. Another benefit is short urls - e.g. 
http://pastebin.com/333

Since then it has found uses in many developer communities and has many
improvements made.

It's been in limbo for a while, but from Oct 2013 has been available on
GitHub.

Forks
=====
* http://bitbucket.org/j-samuel/paste - this is a fork from 2010 and has
  seen a fair amount of activity since then. Worth checking out!


To Do
=====
This started out as a single-script site back in 2002, and grew somewhat
organically. It could use some cleaning up, and in particular, it needs
some unit tests.

Anyone is welcome to make improvements - fork the repository, and if you
would like your changes to be considered for this release, just send me
pull request.
